- detect and prevent fraud and violations of our terms of service,
- understand how visitors use and engage with our Site,
- advertise our products and Services, where allowed, and

## 4. How Embloy Uses Cookies

Cookies play an important role in helping us provide effective and safe Services. Below is a description of the commonly used cookie types and the purposes that apply to them. Each section references Embloy’s [Cookies & Consent Settings Dashboard](https://embloy.com/cookie-settings), where you can find more information about each cookie, including the types and duration of each cookie, and exercise your choices.

Embloy distinguishes between 3 different types of cookies:

### Essential Cookies

Some cookies are essential to the operation of our Site and Services and make it usable and secure by enabling basic functions like page navigation and access to secure areas of the Site. We use those cookies in a number of different ways, including:

- **Authentication**: To remember your login state so you don't have to log in as you navigate through our Site and dashboard.
- **Fraud Prevention and Detection**: Cookies and similar technologies that we deploy through our Site help us learn things about computers and web browsers used to access the Services. This information helps us monitor for and detect potentially harmful or illegal use of our Services. For example, in order to process payments transactions for our Users, it is necessary for Embloy to collect information about the transaction and the Customer. To help secure these transactions and minimize fraud, we collect additional information through the use of cookies and other technologies in helping to identify bad actors and prevent them from making fraudulent transactions. Customers should check our Users' sites for more information about the use of Embloy cookies for fraud detection.
- **Security**: To protect user data from unauthorized access.
- **Operational**: To keep our Site and Services working correctly, like showing you the right information for your selected location.
