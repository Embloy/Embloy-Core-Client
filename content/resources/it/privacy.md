_Last updated on September 19, 2024_

Thank you for your interest in our company and our websites. We take the protection of your personal data and the protection of your privacy very seriously. We want you to know when we store which data and how we use it. Below we would like to inform you about how we handle your data.

This Privacy Policy (“**Policy**”) describes the Personal Data we collect, how we use and share it, along with details on how you can reach out to us with privacy-related inquiries. Additionally, the Policy outlines your rights as a data subject and choices you have, including the right to object to certain usages of your Personal Data by us.

In this Policy, “**Embloy**”, “**we**”, “**our**”, or “**us**” refers to the entity of Embloy Platforms UG (handlungsbeschränkt) responsible for the collection, use, and handling of Personal Data as described in this document.

“**Personal Data**” refers to any information associated with an identified or identifiable individual, which can include data that you provide to us, and we collect about you during your interaction with our Services (such as device information, IP address, etc.).

“**Services**” refer to the products and services provided by Embloy under the Embloy [Terms of Service](https://embloy.com/resources/terms). This may include services and applications provided by Embloy. Our “**Business Services**” are services that we provide to entities (“**Business Users** or **Customers**”) that directly and indirectly provide us with “**End Customer**” Personal Data in connection with their own business operations and activities. Our “**End User Services**” are those that Embloy provides directly to individuals for their personal use. “**Sites**” refer to Embloy.com, Genius.Embloy.com, Apply.Embloy.com, and other Embloy websites, apps, and online services. Collectively, we refer to Sites, Business Services, and End User Services as “**Services**”.

Depending on the context, “**you**” might be an End Customer, End User, or Visitor:

    - When you use an End User Service for personal use, such as creating an Embloy account and managing your applications, we refer to you as an “**End User**”.
    - When you apply to, or otherwise engage with a job posting of a Business User, such as applying to a job of a Business User using Embloy Quicklink, but are not directly transacting with Embloy, we refer to you as an “**End Customer**”.
    - When you interact with Embloy by visiting a Site without being logged into an Embloy account, or when your interaction with Embloy does not involve you being an End User or End Customer you are considered a “**Visitor**”. For example, you are a Visitor when you send a message to Embloy asking for more information about our Services.

In this Policy, “**Transaction Data**” refers to data collected and used by Embloy to facilitate the submission of applications.

Depending on the activity, Embloy assumes the role of a “**data controller**” and/or “**data processor**” (or “**service provider**”) based on the activity. For more details about our role, and our legal bases for processing your Personal Data, please visit https://gdpr-info.eu/.

When you use our website, we process your personal data. We process your data strictly confidentially and only for the purpose we informed you about when collecting the data. Our standards for processing your data are the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and other applicable data protection regulations.
    
## 1. Processing of Personal Data
    ### 1.1. Scope of data processing

    Every time our website is accessed and every time a file is retrieved, data, including personal data, is collected by our systems, and temporarily stored in a log file. The following personal data is processed:

    - IP address (if applicable, in anonymized, shortened form)
    - Date and time of access (timestamp)
    - Access details and destination address (protocol version, HTTP method, referrer, user agent string)
    - Name of the retrieved file and transferred data volume (requested URL incl. query string, size in bytes)
    - Information whether the retrieval was successful (HTTP Status Code)
    - Web page where the request originated
    - Browser type or app used
    - Operating system and its interface
    - Language and version of the browser software

    
    ### 1.2. Purposes of the data processing

    We use the personal data collected during a visit to our websites to protect our IT systems from attacks and other illegal activities and to enable you to surf our websites as comfortably as possible. During this data processing, we do not draw any conclusions about your person. In this regard, neither a personal evaluation nor an evaluation of the data for marketing purposes or profiling takes place. Your data will be deleted after three months at the latest.

    If you provide us with personal data, e.g., as part of a registration or for the execution of a contract (e.g., event participation), we use this data for these purposes. In addition, we use this data for the purposes of customer administration and, if necessary, for the purposes of billing for any business transactions, in each case to the extent necessary for this purpose.

    Insofar as you have given us your consent in the context of our cookie banner (see section 2.), we and, if applicable, third parties will use your personal data to display personalized content or advertising to you based on your usage behavior. Analytical methods such as profiling or scoring may be used for this purpose.

    In addition, we process your data insofar as there is a legal obligation to do so, e.g., in the case of retention obligations under commercial or tax law.

    We use your data to customize the functionality of our websites based on your usage behavior.
    
    ### 1.3. Disclosure of your personal data

    To optimize and secure our websites and to improve our business operations, we may use other external service providers, e.g., data centers, IT service providers. These service providers are carefully selected by us and contractually obligated accordingly. As part of their service provision, it may be necessary for these service providers to process your personal data. However, we only pass on your data insofar as this is necessary for the provision of our websites, to comply with our legal obligations, to protect our legitimate interests or if we have your consent.
    
    ### 1.4. Legal basis of the data processing operations

    If you gave consent for the processing of your personal data, your consent is also the legal basis for the processing, pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR.

    If information from end devices (e.g., cell phones, desktop) is accessed or stored, this is done in accordance with Section 25 TDDDG.

    The legal basis for the processing of your personal data for the performance of a contract, is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR.

    The legal basis for processing your personal data to comply with our legal obligations, is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR.

    If we process your personal data to protect our legitimate interests or those of a third party, Art. 6 (1) f GDPR is the corresponding legal basis. The type of personal data, the purpose of processing, the circumstances of processing and the interest in the confidentiality of the personal data, are considered in the context of the balancing of interests.

    
    ### 1.5. Duration of the storage of your personal data

    As a matter of principle, we delete your personal data as soon as the purpose of processing stated in this data protection declaration ceases to apply. If necessary, storage will take place beyond this point in time, insofar as we are legally obliged to do so, or it is necessary for the defense of legal claims. If deletion should not be possible in individual cases, the data concerned will be blocked for further processing.

## 2. International Data Transfers

    As a global business, it's sometimes necessary for us to transfer your Personal Data to countries other than your own, including the United States. These countries might have data protection regulations that are different from those in your country. When transferring data across borders, we take measures to comply with applicable data protection laws related to such transfer. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests from officials, such as law enforcement or security authorities.
    These transfers are usually based either on adequacy decisions (Art. 45 GDPR), e.g., to Switzerland or the United States. In other cases, the transfer may be based on the use of the EU standard contractual clauses (Art. 46 GDPR) if there is no adequacy decision for the recipient country or the required certifications have not been made (esp. in the case of the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework).

    When a data transfer mechanism is mandated by applicable law, we employ one or more of the following:

    - Transfers to certain countries or recipients that are recognized as having an adequate level of protection for Personal Data under applicable law.  
    - EU Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission and the UK International Data Transfer Addendum issued by the Information Commissioner’s Office. You can obtain a copy of the relevant Standard Contractual Clauses. Learn More.
    - Other lawful methods available to us under applicable law. 
    
    Please note, however, that for individual processing activities it is possible that we transfer the data to a third country whose data protection regulations differ from the GDPR. This affects the applicable level of data protection, e.g., in some cases there may be no comparably effective legal remedies against access to data by state authorities. 
    
    Embloy Platforms UG (haftungsbeschränkt) complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (**EU-U.S. DPF**”), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce and as applicable.


## 3. Cookies, Analysis and Marketing Technologies

    We use cookies and comparable analysis and marketing technologies (“**cookies**”) on our websites. Cookies are stored on your computer and transmitted from it to our websites. A cookie contains a characteristic string of characters that enables your web browser to be uniquely identified when you return to our websites.
    We distinguish between technically necessary cookies (section 3.1.), analytical and statistical cookies (section 3.3.) and marketing cookies (section 3.3.).

    We use analytical and marketing cookies exclusively with your consent, pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR. Please note our information on data transfers to third countries (section 1.4.). The storage or retrieval of information in the terminal device only takes place with your consent, pursuant to Section 25 TDDDG. However, if the storage or retrieval is necessary for the provision of the website, no consent is required, pursuant to Section 25 TDDDG.

    Likewise, you can configure the handling of cookies in your browser yourself. By changing the settings in your browser, you can disable or restrict the transmission of cookies. You can delete cookies that have already been stored at any time. If cookies are deactivated for our websites, it may no longer be possible to use all functions to their full extent.

    These cookies are technically necessary for the proper operation of our websites. Among other things, they ensure the technical stability of our websites and enable security-relevant functionalities. The use of certain functions (e.g., contact forms) is also only made possible by technically necessary cookies. There is no possibility to use our websites without such processing of data, i.e., you have no possibility to object.

    We use this type of cookies to increase the security and functionality of our websites and offered web applications.

    The processing of personal data using necessary cookies is based on Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR. With the use of technically necessary cookies, we aim to simplify the use of our websites for you. Some functions of our websites cannot be offered without the use of cookies. For these, it is necessary that the browser you use is recognized even after a change of website. Our legitimate interest also lies in these purposes. We do not use your user data collected through technically necessary cookies to create user profiles.
    
    ### 3.2 Cookies for statistical analysis

    These cookies enable us to obtain statistical information about the use of our websites and to understand how visitors interact with our websites. With the help of these cookies, we can, for example, determine the number of visitors to our websites and optimize our website content. The data analysis is anonymized.

    You are not obliged to provide your personal data. The provision is neither legally or contractually required nor necessary for the conclusion of a contract. However, failure to provide such data could result in you not being able to use our websites or not being able to use them to their full extent.

    The legal basis for the processing of personal data using cookies for reach measurement is your consent pursuant to Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR. You have the right to revoke your consent at any time without giving reasons with effect for the future.

    ### 3.3 Cookies for marketing and other services

    Usage analysis cookies allow us to analyze how you use our websites. With the help of these cookies, we can test the effectiveness of our websites and detect errors. In addition, these cookies provide insights for optimizing our services and for web analytics. We can also use them to show you usage-based content and personalized advertising.

    You are not obliged to provide your personal data. The provision is neither legally or contractually required nor necessary for the conclusion of a contract. However, failure to provide such data could result in you not being able to use our websites or not being able to use them to their full extent.

## 8. Online Presences in Social Media

    We operate online presences on social networks. On these presences, we regularly publish and share content, offers and information on the activities of Embloy. 

    ### 8.1 Scope of processing

    With every interaction on our social media presences, your personal data is automatically collected and stored by the operators of the respective social network for market research and advertising purposes. It cannot be ruled out that the collected data may also be processed outside the European Union. Among other things, this may make it more difficult to enforce the rights of data subjects. We have no influence on which data is collected and transmitted by the operator of the social network, to which third-party recipients a transmission is made by the operator of the social network and how long the data is stored by the operator of the social network. In this regard, we refer to the privacy statements of the respective social network:

        - Facebook (Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland): https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/  
        - Instagram (Instagram LLC., 1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA): http://instagram.com/about/legal/privacy/  
        - LinkedIn (LinkedIn Corporation, 2029 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA): https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy  
        - Twitter (Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA): https://twitter.com/de/privacy  
        - Xing (XING AG, Dammtorstraße 29-32, 20354 Hamburg): https://privacy.xing.com/de/datenschutzerklaerung   
        - Twitch (Twitch UK Limited, 1 New Oxford Street WC1A 1BA, UK, as agent for Twitch Interactive, Inc., 350 Bush Street, 2nd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94104, USA): https://www.twitch.tv/p/de-de/legal/privacy-notice/
        - TikTok (TikTok Technology Limited, 10 Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin, D02 T380, Ireland): https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/eea/privacy-policy/de-DE

    User profiles are created from the collected data using pseudonyms. These can be used, for example, to place advertisements within and outside the social networks that presumably correspond to your interests. 

    When you access our profile page on one of the networks, the operator may set cookies or similar technologies on your end device, regardless of whether you have an account with this network or whether you are logged in there. This happens, for example, by showing users on the pages of the social network ads from advertising partners of the network whose websites they have previously visited. In addition, cookies make it possible to create statistics about the use of the respective profile page (e.g., number of page views, target groups).

    If we receive such statistical analyses from the operator of the social network, the data is anonymized by the operator beforehand, i.e., it is not possible for us to assign usage data to an individual user. If you are logged in to the social network, however, the operator of the social network may be able to assign the visit to our profile on the platform to your account there. If you want to prevent the collected data from being directly assigned to your user account, you must log out of the respective social network before clicking on the graphic. 

    We generally collect all communications, content, and other information you share with us when you visit our social media presence, such as when you post something on one of our social media presences or send us private messages. In addition, if you have an account on one of these networks, we may see your public information, such as your username, information in your public profile, and content you share with a public audience. The nature, scope and purposes of the processing of your personal data on social networks are primarily determined by the operators of the social networks. For further information on data processing by the respective provider, as well as your rights in this regard and setting options for protecting your privacy, please refer to the data protection information of the social network (see above).

    ### 8.2 Usage analysis (page insights)

    As part of our profiles on social media, the operators of the social network provide us with so-called “**page insights**”. We use Facebook and Instagram Insights to learn more about our account subscribers or their performance. 

    With each of your interactions with our social media profile, Facebook or Instagram records your usage behavior by means of cookies and similar technologies. These are anonymized statistics that can give us information about the interaction with our posts or other content. An assignment to your person is not possible for us. We have no access to the personal data used by Facebook or Instagram for the creation of insights (“**page insights data**”). The selection and processing of Page Insights data is carried out exclusively by the operator of the social network.

    Insights provide us with information on how our audience interacts with specific posts, stories, videos, reels, and live videos. Insights and metrics for our account may also include paid activity. The following Insights are available to us on Facebook and Instagram, respectively: 

        - Current highlights,
        - Overview of reached accounts or accounts that have interacted; 
        - Total number of friends/subscribers;
        - Content we shared;
        - Interactions with our account;
        - Discoveries;
        - Display information. 

    This helps us to optimize our activities on the presences, for example by being able to better respond to the interests and usage habits of our audience when planning and selecting our content.

    As part of the Insights function, Facebook or Instagram may provide us with the following data categories, among others, in anonymized (statistical) form for the purpose of performance measurement and optimization of our presence:

        - Date and time of the action;
        - Country/city of the user,
        - Language code (http status code);
        - Age/Gender Group;
        - Previously visited website;
        - End device of the user;
        - User ID (if logged in).

    Facebook or Instagram and we are joint controllers for the processing of your data in connection with Insights. In this context, the operator of the social network provides the associated IT infrastructure as well as the website of the social network and is the primary contact when it comes to processing your data on the pages of the social network (e.g., information or deletion). Regarding data processing on social networks, we therefore recommend that you contact the respective social network directly for information requests or other questions regarding user rights, such as a deletion request, as only the operators of the social networks have full access to your user data. However, you can also assert your legal rights against us. In this case, we will forward your requests to the operator of the social network if necessary. For this purpose, we have stipulated in an agreement which company fulfills which data protection obligations in accordance with the GDPR regarding the processing of Page Insights data.

    You can view the agreement with Facebook (incl. Instagram as a Facebook product) here:
     https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/page_controller_addendum. 

    A compilation of the key contents of this agreement can be found here:
     https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/information_about_page_insights_data. 
    
    ### 8.3 Legal basis of the processing

    We operate our social media presences in order to inform about our offers and services as well as to provide an additional contact option.

For the processing of your Page Insights data together with Facebook or Instagram, we have agreed with the respective operator that they are primarily responsible for providing you with information about the processing of your Page Insights data and enabling you to exercise your data protection rights under the GDPR (e.g. right to object). You can find more information about your data protection rights in connection with Page Insights directly from the operator of the respective network.

    ### 8.4 Purpose of data processing 

    With our online presences we aim at an effective communication with our customers and interested parties as well as an optimized presentation of our offers.

    You are not obliged to provide your personal data. The provision is neither legally or contractually required nor necessary for the conclusion of a contract. However, failure to provide such data could result in you not being able to use our website and social media sites, or not being able to use them to their full extent.
    
    ### 8.5 Duration of data processing

    We delete private messages that you send to us via social networks within 7 days of the last communication with you. We leave public posts from you (e.g., in our timeline) permanently published until you explicitly request their deletion or delete the posts in question yourself. We reserve the right to delete illegal content published on our profile page, e.g., copyright infringements or criminally relevant statements. In addition, we store usernames and comments that are deleted due to violation of netiquette. These will only be kept for possible proof in case of legal disputes within the statute of limitations.

    The data collected directly by us via the social media presence is deleted from our systems as soon as the purpose for storing it no longer applies, you request us to delete it, revoke your consent to store it, or the purpose for storing the data no longer applies. Stored cookies remain on your terminal device until you delete them. Mandatory legal provisions - in particular retention periods - remain unaffected.

    We have no influence on the storage period of your data, which is stored by the operators of the social networks for their own purposes. For details, please refer to the privacy policy of the respective network (see above).

## 9. Social Plugins

    We use so-called social plugins on our websites, which are provided by third-party providers of social networks. These plugins can be interaction elements or content (graphics, videos, or text contributions).

    In order to increase the protection of your data when visiting our websites, we have only integrated the social plug-ins to a limited extent, i.e., only using an HTML link on our websites. This integration prevents the social plugins integrated on our websites from establishing a connection with the servers of the provider of the respective social network and transmitting your data when you call up our websites.

    Only when you activate the respective plugin by clicking on the associated button, a new window of your browser opens and calls up the page of the respective provider, on which you can (possibly after entering your login data) e.g., press the Like- or Share-button.

    If you are logged in to the respective social network of the third-party provider while visiting our websites, the third-party provider of the respective social network may be able to recognize the information thus collected from your specific visit and assign it to your personal profile or publish it via this. If you want to prevent the assignment, you must either log out of the respective social network before clicking on the social plugin or make the corresponding settings in your user account of the social network.

    The legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. We have a legitimate interest in the best possible presentation of our offer and extensive visibility in social media.

    You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time with effect for the future (see rights of data subjects). You can find more information about your objection options on the websites of the respective providers (see above). We will not subsequently process your personal data any further unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for our processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves to assert, exercise, or defend legal claims. You may also exercise your rights in relation to processing activities concerning our joint responsibility with Facebook with us. In this case, we will forward your request to Facebook without delay to bring about a prompt clarification.

    You are not obliged to provide your personal data. The provision is neither legally or contractually required nor necessary for the conclusion of a contract. However, failure to provide such data could result in you not being able to use our websites or not being able to use them to their full extent.
