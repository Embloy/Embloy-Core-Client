These Embloy Terms of Service (“**Agreement**”) are entered into by and between Embloy Platforms UG (haftungsbeschränkt) (“**Embloy**” or “**we**”) and the entity or person placing an order for or accessing the Service (“**Customer**” or “**you**”). If you are accessing or using the Service on behalf of your company, you represent that you are authorized to accept this Agreement on behalf of your company, and all references to “you” or “Customer” in this Agreement mean your company.

If you have a separate written agreement with Embloy for your use of the Service, this Agreement will not apply to you.

This Agreement permits Customer to purchase subscriptions to the Service and other services from Embloy pursuant to Embloy ordering documents, online registration, order descriptions or order confirmations referencing this Agreement (“**Orders**”) and sets forth the basic terms and conditions under which those products and services will be delivered. This Agreement will govern Customer’s initial purchase on the Effective Date as well as any future purchases made by Customer that reference this Agreement. Certain capitalized terms are defined in Section 20 (Definitions) and others are defined contextually in this Agreement.

The “**Effective Date**” of this Agreement is the date which is the earlier of (a) Customer’s initial access to any Service through any online provisioning, registration or order process or (b) the effective date of the first Order referencing this Agreement.

**Modifications to this Agreement**: From time to time, Embloy may modify this Agreement. Unless otherwise specified by Embloy, changes become effective for Customer upon renewal of Customer’s current Subscription Term or entry into a new Order. Embloy will use reasonable efforts to notify Customer of the changes through communications via Customer’s account, email or other means. Customer may be required to click to accept or otherwise agree to the modified Agreement before renewing a Subscription Term or entering into a new Order, and in any event, continued use of the Service after the updated version of this Agreement goes into effect will constitute Customer’s acceptance of such updated version. If Embloy specifies that changes to this Agreement will take effect prior to Customer’s next renewal or order (such as for legal compliance or product change reasons) and Customer objects to such changes, Customer may terminate the applicable Subscription Term and receive as its sole remedy a refund of any fees Customer has pre-paid for use of the applicable Service for the terminated portion of the Subscription Term.

**BY INDICATING YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE LEGALLY BOUND BY ALL TERMS, CONDITIONS AND NOTICES CONTAINED OR REFERENCED IN THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 16, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SERVICE.**

## 1. Overview
Embloy offers a suite of software-as-a-service solutions designed to optimize processes related to a Customer Application. These Services include the development, trade, distribution and operation of software in the field of recruitment as well as the provision of related services of all kinds. Customer can use SDKs to bundle Service Data about the Customer Application and send that Service Data to the Service. Customer may either create its own SDKs or select from reference SDKs that Embloy makes separately available for different software languages, frameworks and libraries. Customer controls what Service Data (including what, if any, personal information) are sent to and processed by the Service by configuring SDKs and the Service. Customer may also elect to import and export Service Data between the Service and certain Third-Party Platforms (e.g., applicant tracking systems, HR suites and project management solutions) through supported integrations.

## 2. The Service

    ### 2.1 Permitted Use
    During the Subscription Term, Customer may access and use the Service only for its internal business purposes in accordance with any Scope of Use and the Documentation, the AUP and this Agreement.

    ### 2.2 Users
    Only Users may access or use the Service. The Service is not intended for and should not be used by anyone under the age of 16. Customer must ensure that all its Users are over 16 years old. Each User must keep login credentials confidential and not share them with anyone else. Customer is responsible for its Users’ compliance with this Agreement and actions taken through their accounts (excluding misuse of accounts caused by Embloy’s breach of this Agreement). Customer will promptly notify Embloy if it becomes aware of any compromise of any User login credentials. Embloy uses User account information as described in its Privacy Policy, but the Privacy Policy does not apply to Service Data.

    ### 2.3 Restrictions
    Customer will not (and will not authorize anyone else to) do any of the following: (a) provide access to (except for Users), distribute, sell or sublicense the Service to a third party, (b) use the Service on behalf of, or to provide any product or service (except for Customer Applications) to, third parties, (c) use the Service to develop a similar or competing product or service, (d) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or seek to access the source code or non-public APIs to the Service, except to the extent expressly permitted by Law (and then only with prior notice to Embloy), (e) modify or create derivative works of the Service or copy any element of the Service, (f) remove or obscure any proprietary notices in the Service, (g) publish benchmarks or performance information about the Service, (h) interfere with the Service’s operation, circumvent its access restrictions or conduct any security or vulnerability test of the Service or (i) transmit any viruses or other harmful materials to the Service.

    ### 2.4 SDKs
    In order to use the Service, Customer may be required to use SDKs to send Service Data about Customer Applications to the Service. Customer may create its own SDKs or select from reference SDKs that Embloy makes separately available in public repositories (“**Reference SDKs**”). Customer’s use of Reference SDKs is subject to the applicable license terms provided with such Reference SDKs and not the terms of this Agreement. Customer’s failure to properly implement SDKs may cause certain features of the Service to be unavailable or cease to function. The Service excludes SDKs, and Embloy shall have no warranty, support, indemnity or other obligations with respect to SDKs under this Agreement.

## 3. Support
If Customer has purchased a paid subscription to the Service, unless otherwise specified in an Order, during the Subscription Term Embloy will provide Support through Embloy’s online support page for the relevant service, or by email at the email address for the relevant Service, currently [help@embloy.com](mailto:help@embloy.com). Embloy will use reasonable efforts to respond to Support requests during business hours. For free or unpaid subscriptions to the Service, please visit our online support page for any support-related questions.

## 4. Data

    ### 4.1 Submission of Service Data
    Customer controls the types and amounts of Service Data (including what, if any, personal information is included) that are submitted to the Service through Customer’s configuration and use of SDKs, the Service and Third-Party Platforms. Customer is responsible for its configuration of SDKs and the Service (including any decision not to use available data scrubbing tools or other privacy or security settings or features).

    ### 4.2 Data Use

        #### 4.2.1 Service Data
        Subject to this Agreement, and solely to the extent necessary to provide, maintain and improve the Service and Support to Customer, Customer grants Embloy the non-exclusive, worldwide right, during the term of this Agreement, to access, use, process, copy, perform, store, export, transmit and display Service Data. Solely to the extent reformatting Service Data for display in the Service constitutes a modification or derivative work, the foregoing license also includes the right to modify and create derivative works of Service Data. In addition to the rights granted above, Embloy may use Non-Identifying Data for Additional Uses. Only to the extent Customer so authorizes via its configuration of the Service, Embloy may use other elements of Service Data for Additional Uses; provided, however, that Embloy will not disclose any Service Data used in this manner externally unless it has been Aggregated or Anonymized.

        #### 4.2.2 Usage Data
        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, Embloy may collect and use Usage Data to operate, improve and support the Service and for Additional Uses. Embloy will not disclose Usage Data externally, including in benchmarks or reports, unless it has been Aggregated or Anonymized.

    ### 4.3 Security
    Embloy uses reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to protect the Service and Service Data as described in the Security Policy.

    ### 4.4 Personal Data
    Unless Customer and Embloy have entered into a DPA, Customer will not submit any Personal Data to the Service.

    ### 4.5 Protected Health Information
    Embloy makes a BAA available for customers with subscriptions to eligible plans. Unless Customer’s then-current subscription is to an eligible plan and has entered into a BAA with Embloy, Customer will not submit any PHI to the Service.

    ### 4.6 Location
    Embloy will store Service Data in the region selected by Customer through its configuration of the Service. In addition, Embloy may process Service Data in the United States or in countries where its Affiliates and third-party sub-processors are located.

    ### 4.7 Data Export and Deletion
    During the Subscription Term, Customer may export or delete its Service Data from the Service using the export and deletion features described in the Documentation. After the Subscription Term, Embloy will delete Service Data in accordance with its standard schedule and procedures.

## 5. Customer Obligations

    ### 5.1 Generally
    Customer is responsible for all Service Data, including its accuracy, and agrees to comply with Laws and the Documentation in using the Service. Customer represents and warrants that it has made all disclosures and has all rights, consents and permissions necessary to use Service Data with the Service and grant Embloy the rights in Section 4.2 (Data Use), all without violating or infringing Laws, third-party rights (including intellectual property, publicity or privacy rights) or any terms or privacy policies that apply to Service Data.

    ### 5.2 No Sensitive Personal Information
    Customer must not use the Service with Sensitive Personal Information (except as permitted in accordance with Section 4.5 (Protected Health Information)). Except as set forth in a BAA, Customer acknowledges that the Service is not intended to meet any legal obligations for these uses, including HIPAA requirements, and that Embloy is not a Business Associate as defined under HIPAA. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, except for PHI submitted in accordance with Section 4.5 (Protected Health Information), Embloy has no liability for Sensitive Personal Information.

## 6. Suspension of Service
Embloy may suspend Customer’s access to the Service and related services: (i) if Customer breaches Section 2.3 (Restrictions) or Section 5 (Customer Obligations), (ii) if Customer’s account is 30 days or more overdue, (iii) if Customer’s actions risk harm to other customers or the security, availability or integrity of the Service (including by regularly exceeding any applicable rate limits) or (iv) if Customer fails to comply with the AUP. Where practicable, Embloy will use reasonable efforts to provide Customer with prior notice of the suspension. Once Customer resolves the issue requiring suspension, Embloy will promptly restore Customer’s access to the Service in accordance with this Agreement.

## 7. Third-Party Platforms
Certain features or functionality of the Service may require Customer to use Third-Party Platforms. Use of Third-Party Platforms is subject to Customer’s agreement with the relevant provider and not this Agreement. Embloy does not control and has no liability for Third-Party Platforms, including their security, functionality, operation, availability or interoperability or how the Third-Party Platforms or their providers use Service Data. If Customer enables a Third-Party Platform with the Service, Embloy may access and exchange Service Data with the Third-Party Platform on Customer’s behalf.

## 8. No Professional Services
Embloy does not provide any professional, consulting, work-for-hire, custom development or similar services of any type.

## 9. Commercial Terms

    ### 9.1 Subscription Term
    Unless otherwise set forth on the applicable Order, each Subscription Term will automatically renew for an equivalent period unless either party gives the other party notice of non-renewal before the current Subscription Term ends (with respect to Customer, in accordance with Section 9.5 below).

    ### 9.2 Fees and Taxes
    Fees are as described in each Order. Fees are invoiced on the schedule in the Order. Unless the Order provides otherwise, all fees are due within 30 days of the invoice date. Fees for renewal Subscription Terms are at Embloy’s then-current rates, regardless of any discounted pricing in a prior Order. Except as expressly otherwise set forth herein, all fees are non-refundable. All Fees are exclusive of any applicable sales or other taxes or similar fees imposed by any government authority. Customer will (a) pay or reimburse all such taxes and fees (including any interest or penalties), if any, due, based on or measured by amounts payable by Customer under this Agreement (excluding taxes based on Embloy’s net income) or (b) furnish Embloy with evidence acceptable to the applicable government authority to sustain an exemption therefrom. If Customer is required by Laws to deduct withholding taxes from payments to Embloy, Customer will increase the amount payable to Embloy as necessary so that after making all required deductions and withholdings, Embloy receives and retains (free from any tax liability) an amount equal to the amount it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made.

    ### 9.3 On Demand
    If Customer purchases a Service with on-demand usage and exceeds the applicable Scope of Use specified in the Order in a given month, Customer agrees to pay Embloy additional on-demand fees for such excess usage (“**On Demand Usage**”) monthly in arrears at the then-current price for On Demand Usage.

    ### 9.4 Payment via Credit Card
    If Customer is purchasing the Service via credit card, debit card or other payment card (”Credit Card”), the following terms apply:

        #### 9.4.1 Recurring Billing Authorization
        By providing Credit Card information and agreeing to purchase the Service, Customer hereby authorizes Embloy (or its designee) to automatically charge Customer’s Credit Card on the same date of each calendar month (or the closest prior date, if there are fewer days in a particular month) during the Subscription Term for all fees accrued as of that date (if any) in accordance with the applicable Order. Customer acknowledges and agrees that the amount billed and charged each month may vary depending on Customer’s use of the Service and may include fees for On Demand Usage for the prior month.

        #### 9.4.2 Foreign Transaction Fees
        Customer acknowledges that for certain Credit Cards, the issuer of Customer’s Credit Card may charge a foreign transaction fee or other charges.

        #### 9.4.3 Invalid Payment
        If a payment is not successfully settled due to expiration of a Credit Card, insufficient funds, or otherwise, Customer remains responsible for any amounts not remitted to Embloy and Embloy may, in its sole discretion, either (i) invoice Customer directly for the deficient amount, (ii) continue billing the Credit Card once it has been updated by Customer (if applicable) or (iii) terminate this Agreement.

        #### 9.4.4 Changing Credit Card Information
        At any time, Customer may change its Credit Card information by entering updated Credit Card information in its account settings.

        #### 9.4.5 Payment of Outstanding Fees
        Upon any termination, expiration or cancellation of a Subscription Term, Embloy will charge Customer’s Credit Card (or invoice Customer directly) for any outstanding fees for Customer’s use of the Service during the Subscription Term (including any fees for On Demand Usage), after which Embloy will not charge Customer’s Credit Card for any additional fees.

    ### 9.5 Cancellation
    **If Customer does not want to renew a subscription, Customer must cancel its account(s)/subscription(s) from its account settings.** An email or phone request to cancel Customer’s account is not considered notice of non-renewal. Any cancellation will take effect only at the end of Customer’s then-current Subscription Term, and Customer will continue to owe all fees (including, if applicable, monthly subscription fees and fees for any On Demand Usage) for the duration of the then-current Subscription Term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Embloy reserves the right, at its sole and absolute discretion, to permit Customer to cancel its subscription immediately without further liability by making a lump-sum payment to Embloy that is equal to the upcoming three (3) months of subscription fees that Customer would otherwise have owed Embloy.

    ### 9.6 Upgrades and Downgrades
    If Customer upgrades its plan or Scope of Use, we will immediately bill Customer for the applicable subscription fees. Downgrades will go into effect at the end of Customer’s then-current Subscription Term. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account. Downgrading account(s) may cause the loss of Service Data, features, or capacity of such account(s). We do not accept any liability for such loss.

## 10. Disclaimers
**The Service, Support and all related Embloy services are provided “AS IS”. Embloy and its suppliers make no other warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title or noninfringement. Unless otherwise expressly stated in this Agreement, Embloy does not warrant that Customer’s use of the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free, that Embloy will review Service Data for accuracy or that it will maintain Service Data without loss. Embloy is not liable for delays, failures or problems inherent in use of the Internet and electronic communications or other systems outside Embloy’s control or for use of the Service in High Risk Activities. Customer may have other statutory rights, but any statutorily required warranties will be limited to the shortest legally permitted period. Embloy does not warrant that using the Service in combination with third party integrations will guarantee the successful submission of an application or that Customer will be able to speed up, improve or enhance the application process. Embloy makes no warranties regarding the performance of Customer Applications and, as between the parties, Customer is solely responsible for Customer Applications.**

Neither party grants the other any rights or licenses not expressly set out in this Agreement. Except for Embloy’s use rights in this Agreement, between the parties Customer retains all intellectual property and other rights in Service Data provided to Embloy. Except for Customer’s use rights in this Agreement, Embloy and its licensors retain all intellectual property and other rights in the Service and related Embloy technology, templates, formats, machine learning or large language models and dashboards, including any modifications or improvements to these items made by Embloy. If Customer provides Embloy with feedback or suggestions regarding the Service or other Embloy offerings, Embloy may use the feedback or suggestions without restriction or obligation.

## 13. Limitations of Liability

    ### 13.1 Consequential Damages Waiver
    Except for Excluded Claims, neither party (nor its suppliers) will have any liability arising out of or related to this Agreement for any loss of use, lost data, lost profits, failure of security mechanisms, interruption of business or any indirect, special, incidental, reliance or consequential damages of any kind, even if informed of their possibility in advance.

    ### 13.2 Liability Cap
    Except for Excluded Claims, each party’s (and its suppliers’) entire liability arising out of or related to this Agreement will not exceed in aggregate the amounts paid or payable by Customer to Embloy during the prior 12 months under this Agreement.

    ### 13.3 Excluded Claims
    “**Excluded Claims**” means: (a) Customer’s breach of Sections 2.3 (Restrictions) or 5 (Customer Obligations), (b) Customer’s breach of Section 15 (Confidentiality) or (c) amounts payable to third parties under the indemnifying party’s obligations in Section 14 (Indemnification).

    ### 13.4 Nature of Claims and Failure of Essential Purpose

## 14. Indemnification

    ### 14.1 Indemnification by Customer
    Customer will defend Embloy from and against any third-party claim to the extent resulting from Service Data or Customer’s breach or alleged breach of Section 5 (Customer Obligations) and will indemnify and hold harmless Embloy against any damages or costs awarded against Embloy (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) or agreed in settlement by Customer resulting from the claim.

    ### 14.2 Procedures 
    The indemnifying party’s obligations in this Section 14 are subject to receiving (a) prompt notice of the claim, (b) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense and settlement of the claim and (c) all reasonably necessary cooperation of the indemnified party, at the indemnifying party’s expense for reasonable out-of-pocket costs. The indemnifying party may not settle any claim without the indemnified party’s prior consent if settlement would require the indemnified party to admit fault or take or refrain from taking any action (other than relating to use of the Service, when Embloy is the indemnifying party). The indemnified party may participate in a claim with its own counsel at its own expense.

## 15. Confidentiality

    ### 15.1 Definition
    “**Confidential Information**” means information disclosed to the receiving party under this Agreement that is designated by the disclosing party as proprietary or confidential or that should be reasonably understood to be proprietary or confidential due to its nature and the circumstances of its disclosure. Embloy’s Confidential Information includes the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any technical or performance information about the Service. Customer’s Confidential Information includes Service Data.

    ### 15.2 Obligations
    As a receiving party, each party will (a) hold Confidential Information in confidence and not disclose it to third parties except as permitted in this Agreement, including Section 4.2 (Data Use), and (b) only use Confidential Information to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights in this Agreement. The receiving party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors and other representatives having a legitimate need to know (including, for Embloy, the subcontractors referenced in Section 19.9), provided it remains responsible for their compliance with this Section 15 and they are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section 15.

    ### 15.3 Exclusions
    These confidentiality obligations do not apply to information that the receiving party can document (a) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party, (b) it rightfully knew or possessed prior to receipt under this Agreement, (c) it rightfully received from a third party without breach of confidentiality obligations or (d) it independently developed without using the disclosing party’s Confidential Information.

    ### 15.4 Remedies
    Unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone are an insufficient remedy. Each party may seek appropriate equitable relief, in addition to other available remedies, for breach or threatened breach of this Section 15.

## 16. Required Disclosures
Nothing in this Agreement prohibits either party from making disclosures, including of Service Data and other Confidential Information, if required by Law, subpoena or court order, provided (if permitted by Law) it notifies the other party in advance and cooperates in any effort to obtain confidential treatment.

## 17. No-Charge Products
If Customer receives access to the Service or Service features on a no-charge, free or trial basis or as a sandbox, alpha, beta or early access offering (“**No-Charge Products**”), use of such No-Charge Products is permitted only during the period designated by Embloy (or if not designated, 30 days). No-Charge Products are optional and either party may terminate No-Charge Products at any time for any reason. No-Charge Products may be inoperable, incomplete or include features that Embloy may never release, and their features and performance information are Embloy’s Confidential Information. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, Embloy provides no warranty, indemnity, service levels or Support for No-Charge Products and its liability for No-Charge Products will not exceed US$50.

## 18. Publicity
Neither party may publicly announce this Agreement except with the other party’s prior consent or as required by Laws. However, Embloy may include Customer and its trademarks in Embloy’s customer lists and promotional materials, issue a press release identifying Customer as a Embloy customer, inform other potential customers that Customer is a Embloy customer and identify Customer as a customer in other forms of publicity (including, without limitation, case studies and blog posts), but will cease such use at Customer’s written request.

## 19. General Terms

    ### 19.1 Assignment
    Neither party may assign this Agreement without the prior consent of the other party, except that either party may assign this Agreement in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition or other transfer of all or substantially all its assets or voting securities (each, a “**Change of Control**”). If Customer assigns this Agreement in a Change of Control permitted under this Section, Customer will update all necessary details in Customer’s account settings. Any non-permitted assignment is void. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party’s permitted successors and assigns.

    ### 19.2 Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue
    This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California and the United States without regard to conflicts of laws provisions and without regard to the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.

    The prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement will be entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees and costs in connection with such action.

    ### 19.4 Notices

    ### 19.5 Entire Agreement
    This Agreement (which includes all Orders, the Policies and, if applicable, the BAA and the DPA) is the parties’ entire agreement regarding its subject matter and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements regarding its subject matter. In this Agreement, headings are for convenience only and “**including**” and similar terms are to be construed without limitation. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (including electronic copies and PDFs), each of which is deemed an original and which together form one and the same agreement.

    ### 19.6 Amendments
    Except as otherwise provided herein, any amendments, modifications or supplements to this Agreement must be in writing and signed by each party’s authorized representatives or, as appropriate, agreed through electronic means provided by Embloy. Nonetheless, with notice to Customer, Embloy may modify the Policies to reflect new features or changing practices, but the modifications will not materially decrease Embloy’s overall obligations during a Subscription Term. The terms in any Customer purchase order or business form will not amend or modify this Agreement and are expressly rejected by Embloy; any of these Customer documents are for administrative purposes only and have no legal effect.

    ### 19.7 Waivers and Severability
    Waivers must be signed by the waiving party’s authorized representative and cannot be implied from conduct. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, it will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so the rest of this Agreement remains in effect.

    ### 19.8 Force Majeure
    Neither party is liable for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement (except for a failure to pay fees) due to events beyond its reasonable control, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, pandemic, riot, Internet or utility failures, refusal of government license or natural disaster.

    ### 19.9 Subcontractors
    Embloy may use subcontractors and permit them to exercise Embloy’s rights, but Embloy remains responsible for their compliance with this Agreement and for its overall performance under this Agreement.

## 21. Purchase from Reseller
If Customer obtained the Service through an authorized reseller of Embloy (“**Reseller**”), the following terms are applicable and will prevail in event of any conflict with any other provisions of this Agreement:

    ### 21.1
    This Agreement is between Embloy and Customer and governs all access and use of the Service by Customer. Resellers are not authorized to modify this Agreement or make any promises or commitments on Embloy’s behalf, and Embloy is not bound by any obligations to Customer other than as set forth in this Agreement. Embloy is not party to (or responsible under) any separate agreement between Customer and Reseller and is not responsible for the Reseller’s acts, omissions, products or services.

    ### 21.2
    Customer’s order details (e.g., Scope of Use and fees) will be as stated in the Order placed by Reseller with Embloy on Customer’s behalf. The Reseller is responsible for the accuracy of such Order.

    ### 21.3
    The amount paid by Customer to the Reseller will be deemed the amount paid or payable by Customer to Embloy under this Agreement for purposes of Section 13 (Limitations of Liability).

    ### 21.4
    Instead of paying Embloy, Customer will pay the applicable amounts to the Reseller, as agreed between Customer and the Reseller. If the Reseller fails to pay Embloy the applicable fees for Customer’s use of the Service, Embloy reserves the right to terminate the applicable Subscription Term for such Service and all related rights granted hereunder.

    ### 21.5
    In the event Customer is entitled to a refund under this Agreement, Customer must request such refund through the Reseller. Any request sent directly to Embloy may be redirected to the Reseller.

Embloy will have no further liability to Customer in the event the Reseller fails to refund such fees to Customer.
